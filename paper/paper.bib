  abstract = "Evolutionary and organismal biology, similar to other fields in
              biology, have become inundated with data. At the same rate, we
              are experiencing a surge in broader evolutionary and ecological
              syntheses for which tree-thinking is the staple for a variety of
              post-tree analyses. To fully take advantage of this wealth of
              data to discover and understand large-scale evolutionary and
              ecological patterns, computational data integration, i.e. the use
              of machines to link data at large scale by shared entities, is
              crucial. The most common shared entity by which evolutionary and
              ecological data need to be linked is the taxon to which they
              belong. In this paper, we propose a set of requirements that a
              system for defining such taxa should meet for computational data
              science: taxon definitions should maintain conceptual
              consistency, be reproducible via a known algorithm, be
              computationally automatable, and be applicable across the tree of
              life. We argue that Linnaean names based in Linnaean taxonomy, by
              far the most prevalent means of linking data to taxa, fail to
              meet these requirements due to fundamental theoretical and
              practical shortfalls. We argue that for the purposes of
              data-integration we should instead use phylogenetic clade
              definitions transformed into formal logic expressions. We call
              such expressions phyloreferences, and argue that, unlike Linnaean
              names, they meet all requirements for effective data-integration.",

@ARTICLE{De_Queiroz2007-xm,
  title    = "Toward an integrated system of clade names",
  author   = "de Queiroz, Kevin",
  abstract = "Although the proposition that higher taxa should correspond to
              clades is widely accepted, current nomenclature does not
              distinguish clearly between different clades in nested series. In
              particular, the same name is often applied to a total clade, its
              crown clade, and clades originating with various nodes, branches,
              and apomorphies in between. An integrated system of clade names
              is described based on categories of clades defined with respect
              to lineages that have survived to the present time. In this
              system, the most widely known names are applied to crown clades,
              the names of total clades are formed by adding a standard prefix
              to the names of the corresponding crowns, and the names of
              apomorphy clades describe the specific apomorphies with which
              they originated. Relative to traditional approaches, this
              integrated approach to naming clades is both more precise
              concerning the associations of names with particular clades and
              more efficient with regard to the cognitive effort required to
              recognize the names of corresponding crown and total clades. It
              also seems preferable to five alternatives that could be used to
              make the same distinctions. The integrated system of clade names
              has several advantages, including the facilitation of
              communication among biologists who study distantly related
              clades, promoting a broader conceptualization of the origins of
              distinctive clades of extant organisms and emphasizing the
              continuous nature of evolution.",

  abstract  = "The PhyloCode is a set of principles, rules, and recommendations
               governing phylogenetic nomenclature, a system for naming taxa by
               explicit reference to phylogeny. In contrast, the current
               botanical, zoological, and bacteriological codes define taxa by
               reference to taxonomic ranks (e.g., family, genus) and types.
               This code will govern the names of clades; species names will
               still be governed by traditional codes. The PhyloCode is
               designed so that it can be used concurrently with the rank-based
               codes. It is not meant to replace existing names but to provide
               an alternative system for governing the application of both
               existing and newly proposed names. Key Features Provides clear
               regulations for naming clades Based on expressly phylogenetic
